**AellyX is a powerful DDoS toolkit for penetration tests, including attacks for several protocols written in python(3.8).**

Takedown WiFi access points, devices in your network, servers, services, and Bluetooth devices with ease.

Raven(abbreviation) is desinged to help you to **test, understand, and learn from stress-testing** attacks.

Raven can **deal with strong servers** and **can be optimized** for non typical targets.

Raven will fit your purpose, even if it is **jamming down wifi networks or bluetooth devices**.

_I archived this repository because I currently do not want to work on it._

## How to run a DDoS attack

_You probably already know the difference between DoS and DDoS:_
_A DoS Attack is run by a single Maschine and a DDoS Attack by multiple._

_But how do we perform a DDoS Attack using AellyX?_


To connect multiple instances of AellyX, you will then need to open a host.
Just execute the command `server` and define a custom password to prevent others from interfering.
When run, you will receive a URL that you can connect to when executing the `ddos` command.
